# macOS Build & Distribution Guide

This directory contains everything needed to build, sign, and distribute Agent Deck for macOS.

## Prerequisites

1. **Xcode Command Line Tools**
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Rust toolchains** (for universal binary)
   ```bash
   rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
   rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
   ```

3. **librsvg** (for icon generation)
   ```bash
   brew install librsvg
   ```

4. **Apple Developer Account** (for signing & notarization)
   - Enroll at https://developer.apple.com/programs/

```

## Quick Start (After Developer Account Approval)

### 1. Generate App Icon

```bash
./macos/scripts/generate-icon.sh
# Or with custom SVG:
./macos/scripts/generate-icon.sh assets/icons/your-icon.svg
```

### 2. Build the App Bundle

```bash
# Native architecture (ARM or Intel based on your Mac)
./macos/scripts/bundle.sh

# For a specific architecture
./macos/scripts/bundle.sh --arch arm64
./macos/scripts/bundle.sh --arch x86_64
```

**Universal Binary Note:** Building a universal binary locally requires native C libraries
(cairo, freetype) for both architectures, which is complex to set up. The recommended
approach is to use GitHub Actions for universal builds - the workflow automatically
builds on separate runners (ARM and Intel) and combines them with `lipo`.

### 3. Set Up Notarization (One Time)

First, create an app-specific password:
1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com
2. Sign In → Security → App-Specific Passwords
3. Generate a password for "Agent Deck Notarization"

Then store credentials:
```bash
./macos/scripts/setup-notarization.sh agentdeck-notary
```

### 4. Sign and Notarize

```bash
# Find your signing identity
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Sign and notarize
./macos/scripts/sign.sh \
    --identity "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" \
    --keychain-profile agentdeck-notary
```

### 5. Create DMG

```bash
./macos/scripts/create-dmg.sh \
    --identity "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" \
    --keychain-profile agentdeck-notary
```

The final DMG will be at `dist/AgentDeck-X.Y.Z.dmg`

## Certificate Setup

### For GitHub/Website Distribution

In Apple Developer Portal (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates):

1. Create **Developer ID Application** certificate
2. Create **Developer ID Installer** certificate (optional, for pkg)
3. Download and install both certificates

### For App Store

1. Create **Mac App Distribution** certificate
2. Create **Mac Installer Distribution** certificate
3. Create an App ID with identifier `com.agentdeck.AgentDeck`

## Environment Variables

You can set these to avoid passing arguments:

```bash
export SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABC123)"
export TEAM_ID="ABC123"
export KEYCHAIN_PROFILE="agentdeck-notary"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "errSecInternalComponent" during signing

Reset your keychain access:
```bash
security unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

### Notarization fails with "Invalid signature"

Ensure you're using `--options runtime` (hardened runtime) during signing.

### "The signature is invalid" on another Mac

Make sure you stapled the notarization ticket:
```bash
xcrun stapler staple "dist/Agent Deck.app"
```

### Gatekeeper still blocks the app

Check the detailed assessment:
```bash
spctl --assess --type execute -vvv "dist/Agent Deck.app"
```

## App Store Considerations

For App Store distribution, note that:

1. **Sandboxing is required** - Use `entitlements-appstore.plist`
2. **USB HID access** - May require special approval from Apple
3. **Global hotkeys** - May require accessibility permissions review
4. **Review times** - Allow 1-2 weeks for initial review

The App Store build process:
```bash
./macos/scripts/bundle.sh --release --universal
./macos/scripts/sign.sh \
    --identity "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" \
    --appstore
# Then use Xcode or Transporter to upload
```

## Version Updates

When releasing a new version:

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update version in `macos/Info.plist` (CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString)
3. Rebuild and re-sign
